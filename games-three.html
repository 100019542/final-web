						<p>Zero Time Dilemma is an adventure game, and is divided into multiple chapters, representing 90-minute periods; each chapter consists of a narrative section, followed by an escape-the-room puzzle and a moral decision. Narrative sections are presented as three-dimensional animated cinematics, with camera movements and full voice acting in Japanese and English. The chapters, referred to as "fragments",are chosen through the Floating Fragment system, in which the player gets to choose a fragment to play based on an image and a vague description of it. The fragments can be played out of order; the characters lose their memory after each 90-minute period, and do not know where they are in the timeline. When the player completes a fragment, they are returned to the Floating Fragment screen, and the completed fragment is placed in a narrative flowchart, indicating where it takes place in the story.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<h4 class="ztd2">Setting</h4>
						<p>In the fictional chronology of the Zero Escape series, Zero Time Dilemma is set between the events of Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors and Virtue's Last Reward. The setting is inside a facility intended to test the logistics of a Mars colony, and the psychology of the people living within the enclosed colony. The game follows nine characters who have been locked up in an underground nuclear bomb shelter and are forced to play a death game called the Decision Game, which is led by a masked person known as Zero (D.C. Douglas). The shelter is divided into three sections, with three people placed in each section, making up three teams: C-Team, Q-Team, and D-Team. To get to the central elevator hall and escape, the characters need six passwords; one password is revealed each time one of them dies. The characters are all wearing watches that inject them with a drug every 90 minutes, inducing memory loss. Heavily involved in the game's lore is the multiple-worlds theory, where every decision made creates alternate universes where the opposite was chosen; these timelines make up the game's multiple routes.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<h4 class="ztd2">Characters</h4>
						<p>C-Team includes Carlos, a firefighter with a strong sense of justice; Akane (Rena Strober), a member of a secret society working for a peaceful future, and who pretends to be a "neat and clean, ideal Japanese woman"; and Junpei, a childhood friend of Akane's, who has joined a detective agency to find her after she has not been heard from. Q-Team includes Q (Joni Goode), a naive amnesiac boy wearing a spherical helmet; Eric (Keith Silverstein), an ordinary ice cream shop clerk who easily cracks under pressure; and Mira (Rachel Kimsey), who does not show much emotion and is in a relationship with Eric. D-Team includes Diana (Eden Riegel), a pacifist nurse who dislikes fighting; Phi (Karen Strassman), an intelligent woman who participated in the colony together with Akane and Sigma to save the world from a deadly disease called Radical-6; and Sigma (Matthew Mercer), a 67-year-old man in the body of a 22-year-old. Additionally, there is a dog named Gab who is able to pass through vents between the sections to deliver messages between the teams.</p>

						<h4 class="ztd2">Game Summary</h4>
						<p>During an experiment to see the effects of prolonged isolation during a simulated manned mission to Mars, nine people are captured by Zero and imprisoned. Zero explains that if Carlos wins a coin toss, he will set them all free; if he loses, he will force them to play a death game called the Decision Game. The bulk of the game takes place if Carlos loses the coin flip; the group is separated into three wards of the facility. Zero orders each team to vote for another team to be executed; whichever team receives two votes is killed, and any team that abstains receives two votes automatically.</p>
