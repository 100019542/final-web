						<p>The series revolves around the elite high school, Hope's Peak Academy, which, every year, selects "Ultimate" students, talented high school students who are in the top of their field, along with one average "Ultimate Lucky Student" who is chosen by lottery.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<h4>Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc</h4>
						<p>The story is shown from the perspective of the protagonist, Makoto Naegi, who starts a new year at the elite private Hope's Peak Academy, a government-funded school which is renowned for educating students that are top of their expertise. These students are given the title of "Ultimate". However, every year the school hosts a raffle in which every average student nation-wide is entered, and a random student is selected to enter the school as the "Ultimate Lucky Student" - as is the case with Makoto Naegi.
The story revolves around fifteen students who are trapped in the school under the control of a sadistic monochrome bear named Monokuma. They are forced to live a communal lifestyle together under a set amount of rules (included in the e-Handbook) for the rest of their lives, although it is possible to "disrupt the peace" in order to escape. In order to do this, a student must "graduate" from the school by murdering a classmate. After a body has been discovered, the rest of the students must work together to discover the culprit, who is known as the "blackened", while the innocents are on the side of the "whitened," playing off Monokuma's monochromatic color scheme. If the culprit can fool the rest of their classmates, then they alone can graduate the school while the rest of the students will be punished (executed). However, if the classmates uncover the true culprit, then the culprit alone will be punished with a gruesome execution while everyone else remains unharmed.

In each chapter, Monokuma releases motives to encourage students to commit a murder. During this time, the students attempt to uncover the secrets of the school, including why they were trapped there in the first place, as well as other ways to escape the school other than the graduation clause.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<h4>Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair</h4>
						<p>The sequel takes place on a tropical island known as Jabberwock. Hajime Hinata, a student who has no memory of his Ultimate talent, along with fifteen other students, are taken there by a rabbit named Usami, who states it to be a field trip to help the classmates make friends with each other. However, Monokuma interferes yet again, turning it into yet another killing game.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<h4>Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls</h4>
						<p>The game takes place half a year after the events of the first game, prior to the events of the second game. Komaru Naegi, the younger sister of the first game's protagonist, Makoto Naegi, has spent the past year locked inside an apartment complex in Towa City, unaware of the events that have gone on in the outside world. She is suddenly forced to flee when was she attacked by deadly Monokuma robots and comes across Future Foundation member Byakuya Togami, who gives Komaru a special Hacking Gun that can fight against the robot and orders her to escape the city. However, Komaru's escape fails and she is captured by a group of elementary-school children known as the Warriors of Hope, who seek to create a utopia for children by murdering all the adults with their robots. They force Komaru to join their "Demon Hunting" game and drop her into the city, where she meets Toko Fukawa, a survivor of Hope's Peak Academy who now uses a stun-gun to control her murderous split personality, Genocide Jack. Learning that Byakuya may have been kidnapped by the Warriors of Hope, Toko agrees to team up with Komaru to find Byakuya and escape the city. Along the way they encounter a resistance group, run by Haiji Towa, and meet a white bear robot named Shirokuma.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<h4>New Danganronpa V3: Everyone's New Semester of Killing <small>coming soon</small></h4>
						<p>It's the third main title in the game series and it's both a sequel and something new for the series. The game has a completely different storyline, characters and environment than the first three games, with only the series' mascot Monokuma returning. Furthermore, the "V" in the title doesn't mean just "Version", as it's mentioned to have more than one meaning, such as "Victory" and "Violence".</p>
